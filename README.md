# Lab 3 PHP Login and Session Handling in PHP


This is a simple PHP application that allows users to login and access protected pages. 
The application uses session handling to keep track of the user's login status, 
and cookies to remember the user's username between sessions.
This project was created as part of a university lab exercise,
so the password is embedded with the username in the code for demonstration purposes only.
